# plutus-pioneer-program
This is just the code from the Plutus Pioneer Program. 

Everything was done on the main repo for the pioneer program and this code was then copied and pasted after being written there. 

I am not forking over a whole repo when I can just keep track of the code I need.

I am following along with each week lessons and since I have gone through basic Haskell syntax and knowledge for functional programming I am confident I am ready to begin writing basic on-chain and off-chain scripts.
