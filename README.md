# plutus-pioneer-program
This is just the code from the Plutus Pioneer Program. 

Everything was done on the main repo for the pioneer program and this code was then copied and pasted after being written there. 

I am not forking over a whole repo when I can just keep track of the code I need.

I am following along with each week lessons and since I have gone through basic Haskell syntax and knowledge for functional programming I am confident I am ready to begin writing basic on-chain and off-chain scripts.

Week one was basic environment setup and eutxo stuff. I have plenty of notes I may upload at some point but yea. no folder for it. 

Week nine looks at the Marlowe language which is used heavily in financial applications which I will not be focusing my work on so I will not be going through this lecture but may take a peek at a later time.
